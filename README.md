# MSML: Enhancing Occlusion-Robustness by Multi-Scale Segmentation-Based Mask Learning for Face Recognition (AAAI-2022)

## Introduction
This is an official implementation of AAAI 2022 paper "MSML: Enhancing Occlusion-Robustness by Multi-Scale Segmentation-Based Mask Learning for Face Recognition".

For occluded face recognition, the MSML network can effectively identify and remove the occlusions from feature representations at multiple levels and aggregate features from visible facial areas.
